# Types of BC, one for each group of lines (same order as in mesh file). Type 1
corresponds to an imposed heat flux, and type 2 corresponds to a boundary value
for the temperature.

BCT = 1,1,1



# Values for the BC. If type 1 and the corresponding heat transfer coefficient
is different from 0, it corresponds to the external temperature (assuming a
convective heat flux). If type 1 and the correspoding heat transfer coefficient
is 0, then it corresponds to the value of the heat flux (in W). For adiabatic
boundaries, specify 0.0. If type 2, it is the value of the temperature.

T0 = 300.0



# Heat transfer coefficients (W/m2K). One must be provided for each BC. If the
BC is type 2, its value is not important. If the BC is type 1 with fixed heat
flux, its value should be 0.0.
